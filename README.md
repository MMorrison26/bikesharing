# In the Business of Bikesharing
## *From New York to Des Moines*

### *Overview*
After experiencing the joy and convenience of bikesharing in New York City, Kate and I are digging into bikesharing data from Citibike to see if a similar business might thrive in Des Moines, Iowa. An investor interested in seed funding would like to see some of this research to see if the idea is worth investing in.

### *Results*
If you take a look at the Tableau Story included in the link below, you will see the following takeaways from the provided visualizations:
* Bike trip durations are usually less than 20 minutes to conveniently get from starting location to destination.
* Males check out bikes at a rate about 3 times as much as females do.
* Popular timeframes for checking out bikes include 7-9 in the morning and again at 5-7 in the evening.
* Males and females have the same trend as far as popular times for check-out (unusually low on Wednesdays and exceedingly popular on Thursdays), but males dominate the usage of these bikes.
* When excluding "unknown" gender, Male Subscribers are the most popular type of user by far of the 4 user subcategories.
* When considering ad campaigns, you can see people around 25-35 are most often the age of the bike users (again many more males than females).
* Darker (touristy) areas are the most popular starting locations for Citibike. We'll need to identify those ares in Iowa.

### *Sumary*
There is great success for Citibike in New York among young to middle aged customers in the morning and afternoon commuting hours with some leisurely usage over the weekend.
